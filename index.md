Hello, I'm Steven Chen! I'm an undergraduate student at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu) majoring in Computer Science. At UT Austin, I am a [Turing Scholar][turing] and [Dean's Scholar][deans], as well as a research assistant working on computer vision and machine learning. 

I'm interested in machine learning, computer vision, data science, and [IoT][iot], among many other things. I'm currently conducting research with Professor Kristen Grauman on computer vision and machine learning, with an undergraduate thesis in the works.

In summer 2016, I interned at Google in Mountain View, where I worked on [Google Photos][photos] MapReduce backend. Before that, I interned at [RetailMeNot][rmn] in Austin on backend services. This summer 2017, I'm excited to be interning at [Riot Games][riot] in Los Angeles as a Data Science Intern.

You can find my [resum√© here][resume].

In my free time, I like traveling, playing music, auto racing, video games, music and Star Trek. Here are a couple of [my favorite][favorites] board games and PC games. I'm also a [Google Local Guide][local], and I enjoy posting reviews
and photos of places I go on Google Maps.

I post about things I find interesting or helpful at [my blog][blog], feel free to take a look below!
