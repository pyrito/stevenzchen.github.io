Hello, I'm Steven Chen! I'm an undergraduate at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu) majoring in Computer Science. At UT Austin, I am a part of the [Turing Scholars][turing] and [Dean's Scholars][deans] honors programs.

I'm interested in machine learning, computer vision, data science, and software engineering, among many other things. I'm currently conducting research with Professor Kristen Grauman on computer vision and machine learning, with an undergraduate thesis in the works.

I will be graduating from UT Austin with a Bachelors in Computer Science in May 2017, and continuing with a Masters in Computer Science.

In summer 2016, I interned at Google in Mountain View, where I worked on [Google Photos][photos] MapReduce backend. Before that, I interned at [RetailMeNot][rmn] in Austin on backend services. This summer, I'm excited to be interning at [Riot Games][riot] in LA as a data science intern.

You can find my **[resum√© here][resume]**.

In my free time, I love traveling, playing music, gaming, [experiencing architecture][arch], and Star Trek. Here are a couple of [my favorite][favorites] board games and PC games. I'm also a [Google Local Guide][local].

I post about things I hope are interesting or helpful on [my blog][blog], feel free to take a look below!
