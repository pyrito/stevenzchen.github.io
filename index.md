Hello, I'm Steven Chen! I'm currently an undergraduate at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu) majoring in Computer Science. At UT Austin, I am a [Turing Scholar][turing] and [Dean's Scholar][deans], as well as an undergraduate researcher in computer vision and machine learning. 

I'm interested in backend development, app development, [AI][ai], and [IoT][iot], among many other things. Recently, I have been involved in iOS development, as well as competitive programming.

Last summer, I interned at [RetailMeNot][rmn] in Austin, and this summer, I'm excited to be a software engineering intern at [Google][google] in [Mountain View][mtnview], on the [Photos][photos] team!

You can find my [resum√© here][resume].

In my free time, I like traveling, playing board games, auto racing, video gaming, music and sci-fi. Here are a couple of [my favorite][favorites] board games and PC games.

I post about things I find interesting at [my blog][blog], feel free to check it out!
